<br>

I come from [Yibin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibin), Sichuan, a region with a profound cultural and historical legacy. Upon completion of my secondary education in China, I initiated an international educational journey in 2015, commencing with high school in Amesbury, Massachusetts. This experience fostered my interest in examining global issues, particularly those pertaining to health.

<br>

# Educational Path

After high school, I attended the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Food Systems, Nutrition, and Health with a minor in Global Health under the [School of Public Health](https://sph.washington.edu/). My undergraduate studies provided me with a strong foundation in understanding the interconnections of health, nutrition, and social systems.

I am currently pursuing a [Master of Public Health (MPH) in Epidemiology](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, where I am developing advanced research skills and focusing on public health analysis. 

<br>

# Research and Professional Experience
Throughout my academic career, Iâ€™ve been actively involved in various research projects and internships that allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-world public health challenges. Some of my key projects include:

**Romani Women Health Study**:
Under the guidance of the [VIBE Research Lab](https://www.viberesearchlab.org/), I analyze the impact of discrimination on access to maternal healthcare, focusing on disparities related to ethnicity, income, and location.
<br>
â†’ Assess the influence of discrimination on the access and quality of maternal healthcare services.
<br>
â†’ Analyze the frequency and timing of initial antenatal visits in relation to discriminatory experiences.
<br>
â†’ Investigate disparities in maternal healthcare quality based on ethnicity, income level, insurance status, and geographic location. 

**Cancer Epidemiology with the [DCPP](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pooling-project/about-the-study/)**: 
Investigating the influence of body measurements and physical activity on colorectal cancer risk, using data from 27 cohort studies.
<br>
â†’ Investigated the association between body measurements, physical activity, and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, with a focus on the role of family history.
<br>
â†’ Prepared, cleaned, and analyzed cohort data to assess the relationship between anthropometric factors and CRC, using stratified analyses by familial risk.

**Global Health Challenges**: 
Conducting studies on smallpox eradication, HPV awareness, and pandemic interventions, particularly focusing on maternal health during COVID-19.
<br>
â†’ Evaluated how different social and medical interventions are used during the pandemic. 
<br>
â†’ Analyzed the existing strategies and how they are not effective enough to overcome certain special situations that pregnant women may experience during pandemic.

# Skills and Technical Expertise
In my research, I leverage tools and skills like:

**Statistical Analysis**: Proficient in SAS and R for data modeling, cohort analysis, and epidemiological research.

**Languages**: Fluent in Mandarin and English, with basic knowledge of French.

**Project Collaboration**: Experienced in team-based research, leading group projects, and independent research initiatives.

<br>

# Life Beyond Epidemiology
When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy exploring different facets of life that bring me joy and balance:

**Photography**: Capturing portraits and landscapes.

**Cooking**: Particular interest in making spicy dishes.
